# Learning web3
This repo is here to collect and document learning resources, code, commands and just about anything that could be helpful in learning web3 by writing proof of concept applications on Ethereum.

## Ways to think about web3

Different ways to think about and frame web3. Might not all be the original authors of the content, the important part is the ideas them selves. The web is full of buzzwords and web3 has lots of it, that is why thinking about the ideas and philosophies helps :)
